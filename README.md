### `thywidom`

The pursuit of wisdom through humility guides my approach to both code and life. I believe that true knowledge comes from acknowledging how much we don't yet understand. With each line of code written, each problem solved, I'm reminded that growth comes from embracing challenges with curiosity and openness.

Simplicity, mindfulness, and continuous learning form the foundation of my work. In a world of increasing complexity, I find clarity in minimalist design and thoughtful solutions.

### `about`

I'm currently focused on building elegant web applications that solve real-world problems. My journey has led me to explore the depths of system design and architecture, finding beauty in well-structured systems that stand the test of time.

Backend development and cloud computing particularly fascinate me—there's something profound about creating invisible infrastructure that powers experiences for thousands of users.
